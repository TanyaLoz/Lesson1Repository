I chose to work with Eclipse IDE for my Java/GitHub projects because I felt
confident enough with the program, while still having some room for improvement. 
I wanted to learn more about Eclipse IDE and get very familiar with it and expand my  
knowledge with it because I often hear people referring to it. Ultimately, I think it will 
work well with my goals for this class.
