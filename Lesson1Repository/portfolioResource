GitHub and GitHub Pages have revolutionized the way prospective employees
display their skills and projects by allowing people to customize the way they present their
work.Unlike a traditional paper portfolio, these tools allow for an efficient way to show off and 
express one's hard work. Through customization and direct links to your work GitHub makes it easy for employees,
colleagues, etc. to get a look into your work. In the future, I hope to set up my own web page displaying my projects, 
information, and expressing my talents.
